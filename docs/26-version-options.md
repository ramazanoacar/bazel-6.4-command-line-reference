## Version Options

Options that appear before the command and are parsed by the client:

`--distdir=<a path>` multiple uses are accumulated
:   Additional places to search for archives before accessing the network to download them.
      
    Tags:
    [`bazel_internal_configuration`](#effect_tag_BAZEL_INTERNAL_CONFIGURATION)

`--[no]experimental_repository_cache_hardlinks` default: "false"
:   If set, the repository cache will hardlink the file in case of a cache hit, rather than copying. This is intended to save disk space.
      
    Tags:
    [`bazel_internal_configuration`](#effect_tag_BAZEL_INTERNAL_CONFIGURATION)

`--[no]experimental_repository_cache_urls_as_default_canonical_id` default: "false"
:   If true, use a string derived from the URLs of repository downloads as the canonical\_id if not specified. This causes a change in the URLs to result in a redownload even if the cache contains a download with the same hash. This can be used to verify that URL changes don't result in broken repositories being masked by the cache.
      
    Tags:
    [`loading_and_analysis`](#effect_tag_LOADING_AND_ANALYSIS), [`experimental`](#metadata_tag_EXPERIMENTAL)

`--[no]experimental_repository_disable_download` default: "false"
:   If set, downloading external repositories is not allowed.
      
    Tags:
    [`experimental`](#metadata_tag_EXPERIMENTAL)

`--experimental_repository_downloader_retries=<an integer>` default: "0"
:   The maximum number of attempts to retry a download error. If set to 0, retries are disabled.
      
    Tags:
    [`experimental`](#metadata_tag_EXPERIMENTAL)

`--experimental_scale_timeouts=<a double>` default: "1.0"
:   Scale all timeouts in Starlark repository rules by this factor. In this way, external repositories can be made working on machines that are slower than the rule author expected, without changing the source code
      
    Tags:
    [`bazel_internal_configuration`](#effect_tag_BAZEL_INTERNAL_CONFIGURATION), [`experimental`](#metadata_tag_EXPERIMENTAL)

`--http_timeout_scaling=<a double>` default: "1.0"
:   Scale all timeouts related to http downloads by the given factor
      
    Tags:
    [`bazel_internal_configuration`](#effect_tag_BAZEL_INTERNAL_CONFIGURATION)

`--repository_cache=<a path>` default: see description
:   Specifies the cache location of the downloaded values obtained during the fetching of external repositories. An empty string as argument requests the cache to be disabled.
      
    Tags:
    [`bazel_internal_configuration`](#effect_tag_BAZEL_INTERNAL_CONFIGURATION)

Options that let the user configure the intended output, affecting its value, as opposed to its existence:

`--[no]gnu_format` default: "false"
:   If set, write the version to stdout using the conventions described in the GNU standards.
      
    Tags:
    [`affects_outputs`](#effect_tag_AFFECTS_OUTPUTS), [`execution`](#effect_tag_EXECUTION)

Options that affect how strictly Bazel enforces valid build inputs (rule definitions, flag combinations, etc.):

`--experimental_repository_hash_file=<a string>` default: ""
:   If non-empty, specifies a file containing a resolved value, against which the repository directory hashes should be verified
      
    Tags:
    [`affects_outputs`](#effect_tag_AFFECTS_OUTPUTS), [`experimental`](#metadata_tag_EXPERIMENTAL)

`--experimental_verify_repository_rules=<a string>` multiple uses are accumulated
:   If list of repository rules for which the hash of the output directory should be verified, provided a file is specified by --experimental\_repository\_hash\_file.
      
    Tags:
    [`affects_outputs`](#effect_tag_AFFECTS_OUTPUTS), [`experimental`](#metadata_tag_EXPERIMENTAL)

This option affects semantics of the Starlark language or the build API accessible to BUILD files, .bzl files, or WORKSPACE files.:

`--[no]experimental_allow_top_level_aspects_parameters` default: "true"
:   No-op
      
    Tags:
    [`no_op`](#effect_tag_NO_OP), [`deprecated`](#metadata_tag_DEPRECATED), [`experimental`](#metadata_tag_EXPERIMENTAL)

Options relating to Bzlmod output and semantics:

`--allow_yanked_versions=<a string>` multiple uses are accumulated
:   Specified the module versions in the form of `<module1>@<version1>,<module2>@<version2>` that will be allowed in the resolved dependency graph even if they are declared yanked in the registry where they come from (if they are not coming from a NonRegistryOverride). Otherwise, yanked versions will cause the resolution to fail. You can also define allowed yanked version with the `BZLMOD\_ALLOW\_YANKED\_VERSIONS` environment variable. You can disable this check by using the keyword 'all' (not recommended).
      
    Tags:
    [`loading_and_analysis`](#effect_tag_LOADING_AND_ANALYSIS)

`--check_bazel_compatibility=<error, warning or off>` default: "error"
:   Check bazel version compatibility of Bazel modules. Valid values are `error` to escalate it to a resolution failure, `off` to disable the check, or `warning` to print a warning when mismatch detected.
      
    Tags:
    [`loading_and_analysis`](#effect_tag_LOADING_AND_ANALYSIS)

`--check_direct_dependencies=<off, warning or error>` default: "warning"
:   Check if the direct `bazel\_dep` dependencies declared in the root module are the same versions you get in the resolved dependency graph. Valid values are `off` to disable the check, `warning` to print a warning when mismatch detected or `error` to escalate it to a resolution failure.
      
    Tags:
    [`loading_and_analysis`](#effect_tag_LOADING_AND_ANALYSIS)

`--[no]ignore_dev_dependency` default: "false"
:   If true, Bazel ignores `bazel\_dep` and `use\_extension` declared as `dev\_dependency` in the MODULE.bazel of the root module. Note that, those dev dependencies are always ignored in the MODULE.bazel if it's not the root module regardless of the value of this flag.
      
    Tags:
    [`loading_and_analysis`](#effect_tag_LOADING_AND_ANALYSIS)

`--lockfile_mode=<off, update or error>` default: "off"
:   Specifies how and whether or not to use the lockfile. Valid values are `update` to use the lockfile and update it if there are changes, `error` to use the lockfile but throw an error if it's not up-to-date, or `off` to neither read from or write to the lockfile.
      
    Tags:
    [`loading_and_analysis`](#effect_tag_LOADING_AND_ANALYSIS)

`--override_module=<an equals-separated mapping of module name to path>` multiple uses are accumulated
:   Override a module with a local path in the form of <module name>=<path>. If the given path is an absolute path, it will be used as it is. If the given path is a relative path, it is relative to the current working directory. If the given path starts with '%workspace%, it is relative to the workspace root, which is the output of `bazel info workspace`

`--registry=<a string>` multiple uses are accumulated
:   Specifies the registries to use to locate Bazel module dependencies. The order is important: modules will be looked up in earlier registries first, and only fall back to later registries when they're missing from the earlier ones.
      
    Tags:
    [`changes_inputs`](#effect_tag_CHANGES_INPUTS)

Options that affect the verbosity, format or location of logging:

`--[no]experimental_record_metrics_for_all_mnemonics` default: "false"
:   By default the number of action types is limited to the 20 mnemonics with the largest number of executed actions. Setting this option will write statistics for all mnemonics.

Options specifying or altering a generic input to a Bazel command that does not fall into other categories.:

`--experimental_resolved_file_instead_of_workspace=<a string>` default: ""
:   If non-empty read the specified resolved file instead of the WORKSPACE file
      
    Tags:
    [`changes_inputs`](#effect_tag_CHANGES_INPUTS)

Remote caching and execution options:

`--experimental_downloader_config=<a string>` default: see description
:   Specify a file to configure the remote downloader with. This file consists of lines, each of which starts with a directive (`allow`, `block` or `rewrite`) followed by either a host name (for `allow` and `block`) or two patterns, one to match against, and one to use as a substitute URL, with back-references starting from `$1`. It is possible for multiple `rewrite` directives for the same URL to be give, and in this case multiple URLs will be returned.

Miscellaneous options, not otherwise categorized.:

`--override_repository=<an equals-separated mapping of repository name to path>` multiple uses are accumulated
:   Override a repository with a local path in the form of <repository name>=<path>. If the given path is an absolute path, it will be used as it is. If the given path is a relative path, it is relative to the current working directory. If the given path starts with '%workspace%, it is relative to the workspace root, which is the output of `bazel info workspace`

### Option Effect Tags

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `unknown` | This option has unknown, or undocumented, effect. |
| `no_op` | This option has literally no effect. |
| `loses_incremental_state` | Changing the value of this option can cause significant loss of incremental state, which slows builds. State could be lost due to a server restart or to invalidation of a large part of the dependency graph. |
| `changes_inputs` | This option actively changes the inputs that bazel considers for the build, such as filesystem restrictions, repository versions, or other options. |
| `affects_outputs` | This option affects bazel's outputs. This tag is intentionally broad, can include transitive affects, and does not specify the type of output it affects. |
| `build_file_semantics` | This option affects the semantics of BUILD or .bzl files. |
| `bazel_internal_configuration` | This option affects settings of bazel-internal machinery. This tag does not, on its own, mean that build artifacts are affected. |
| `loading_and_analysis` | This option affects the loading and analysis of dependencies, and the building of the dependency graph. |
| `execution` | This option affects the execution phase, such as sandboxing or remote execution related options. |
| `host_machine_resource_optimizations` | This option triggers an optimization that may be machine specific and is not guaranteed to work on all machines. The optimization could include a tradeoff with other aspects of performance, such as memory or cpu cost. |
| `eagerness_to_exit` | This option changes how eagerly bazel will exit from a failure, where a choice between continuing despite the failure and ending the invocation exists. |
| `bazel_monitoring` | This option is used to monitor bazel's behavior and performance. |
| `terminal_output` | This option affects bazel's terminal output. |
| `action_command_lines` | This option changes the command line arguments of one or more build actions. |
| `test_runner` | This option changes the testrunner environment of the build. |

### Option Metadata Tags

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `experimental` | This option triggers an experimental feature with no guarantees of functionality. |
| `incompatible_change` | This option triggers a breaking change. Use this option to test your migration readiness or get early access to the new feature |
| `deprecated` | This option is deprecated. It might be that the feature it affects is deprecated, or that another method of supplying the information is preferred. |
| `explicit_in_output_path` | This option is explicitly mentioned in the output directory. |
